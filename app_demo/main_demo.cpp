            - Inserting nodes into the AVLTree in random order
                - Displaying an error message if a duplicate node is inserted
            - Using the Find Function to find a node by statValue
                - demonstrating both a found node and a not found node
            - Creating a visual GraphViz representation of the AVLTree with all nodes added
            - Listing the stats in order with all nodes added
            - Removing a node from the AVLTree by statValue
            - Creating a visual GraphViz representation of the AVLTree after a node has been removed
            - Listing the stats in order after a node has been removed

  Very large AVL Tree

        This section demonstrates:
            - Mocking up the creation of a very large AVLTree
            - Creating a visual GraphViz representation of the AVLTree periodically to demonstrate
                the adherence to the AVLTree invariants 
            - These trees are randomly created every time the program is run, GraphViz files
                are created with timestamps appended by a _int to prevent overwriting
